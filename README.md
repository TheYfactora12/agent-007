# Agent 007 — Project AI Workforce

> A project-specific AI agent operating system built on the [`msitarzewski/agency-agents`](https://github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents) pattern, stress-tested and mapped to the actual lifecycle of **Blackhat**, **RiskStack Labs / Merlin**, and the **Pokémon Champions Sim**.

---

## What this is

This repo is the living operating manual for how AI agents are assigned, activated, and held accountable on every project in this org. Every agent has:

- A clear **identity and mission**
- A defined **lifecycle gate** where it activates
- Explicit **deliverables** and **success metrics**
- A **system prompt** ready to paste into Claude, Cursor, Copilot, or any CLAUDE.md

## Lifecycle map

| Phase | Active agents | Gate output |
|---|---|---|
| Discovery | Software Architect, InfoSec Risk Officer, Offline AI Architect | Scope + risk statement |
| Architecture | Software Architect, Security Engineer, DevOps Automator | ADR log + threat model |
| Engineering build | Code Reviewer, Technical Writer, Security Engineer | Reviewed PRs + runbook draft |
| Design | UI Designer, UX Researcher, Accessibility Auditor | Component spec + usability findings |
| QA + Release | Evidence Collector, Reality Checker, Accessibility Auditor | Go/no-go memo + defect log |
| Post-release | Model Risk Governance, InfoSec Risk Officer | Risk register update + monitoring plan |

## How to use an agent

**Option A — Claude Code / Cursor / Copilot:**
Copy the system prompt from the agent's `.md` file into your `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, or chat system message.

**Option B — Standalone chat:**
Paste the system prompt as the first message in a new conversation, then describe your task.

**Option C — Multi-agent chain:**
Run agents in sequence using a playbook from `/playbooks/`. Each playbook defines which agent runs first, what it produces, and what the next agent consumes.
